    <h2 id="informationwecollect">1. Information We Collect and How We Use It</h2>

    <p>AHA collects information from several sources that enables AHA to identify or contact you (“Personal Information”). An AHA website collects Personal Information in a variety of manners and the types of Personal Information we may collect from you will depend on the products and services you choose.</p>

    <p>Our Web server automatically collects the domain name and Internet Protocol (“IP”) address for each visitor to our websites. We collect information about the usage of our websites. In addition, we may request or require you to provide Personal Information and/or create an account in order to access certain services or engage in certain activities on an AHA website. The information collected depends on how you choose to use our services and our websites, as detailed below.</p>

    <p>The types of Personal Information we collect includes, but is not limited to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>General information (e.g., your name, date of birth, home and business address, email address, phone number, and other types of demographic information)</li>
        <li>Professional information (e.g., occupation, place of employment, professional history)</li>
        <li>Financial information (e.g., credit card information, billing information)</li>
        <li>IP addresses</li>
        <li>Individual responses to surveys</li>
        <li>Topical areas of interest</li>
        <li>Website usage (e.g., search terms, referring/exit pages, time on a website, number of clicks)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>AHA also collects information that is about you individually, but that does not directly identify you as you interact with an AHA website (“Non-Personal Information”). The types of Non-Personal Information we collect includes, but is not limited to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Products and services viewed</li>
        <li>Internet service provider</li>
        <li>Geolocation data</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="commonlyacceptedpractices">a. Commonly Accepted Practices</h3>

    <p>Personal Information collected may be used for commonly accepted practices, including:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Product service fulfillment, such as the use of addresses for shipping and credit card information for payment;</li>
        <li>Sending electronic publications to online subscribers;</li>
        <li>Administration of our websites and monitoring usage of our websites;</li>
        <li>Internal operations, such as the use of identity-verification technologies, and the review of server logs;</li>
        <li>Legal compliance and public purposes, such as subpoena compliance and credit reporting;</li>
        <li>Registration and participation in AHA products, services, and communities; and</li>
        <li>Marketing of products and services to you by AHA, such as the recommendation of products or the delivery of coupons based upon prior purchases.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>We use Non-Personal Information to improve the usability of our websites and for other business reasons. We or other third party companies also use the Non-Personal Information to provide advertisements and targeted advertisements to you based on the Non-Personal Information.</p>

    <h3 id="informationcollectedtocreateanaccount">b. Information Collected to Create an Account</h3>

    <p>There are times when AHA may request or require you to create an account with us in order to obtain certain services. In such cases we may collect user name or ID and password information from you. We use this information to verify users’ identities in order to prevent unauthorized access to users’ personal information. AHA allows account holders to elect to have the AHA website remember their login information between visits so they do not have to log in each time. This is done by checking a box labeled “remember me” on the login page. This feature requires the placement of a small text file called a cookie (see next section) on the user’s hard drive. The cookie tells the site that the user has logged in before. As part of registering for some of AHA’s products and affiliates, we may collect contact and demographic information such as your name, address, email address, etc. We may also collect information regarding your personal and professional history, interests, activities, experiences and interests in health care products and services. Certain information may be required in order to complete the registration process.</p>

    <h3 id="cookies">c. Cookies</h3>

    <p>Several portions of the AHA websites use cookies. Cookies are small data files that are transferred to your computer through your Web browser. Cookies are used by most websites. We may use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (i) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during subsequent visits; (ii) provide personalized content on AHA.org and to provide targeted advertising on other sites; (iii) monitor effectiveness of marketing campaigns; (iv) record site analytics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (v) track your entries, submissions and communications. Certain features of our website require cookies in order to function properly.</p>

    <p>Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Some AHA website features and services may not function properly if you set your browser to refuse cookies. If you view an AHA website without changing your cookie settings, you are indicating your consent to receive all cookies (that are not related to third party advertisers and analytics providers) from the AHA website. For more information on managing cookies operated by third party advertisers and analytics providers, please see <a href="#thirdpartyadvertisers">Third Party Advertisers and Analytics</a> below.</p>

    <h3 id="emailaddresses">d. Email Addresses and Mailing Lists</h3>

    <p>AHA collects and uses the email addresses and mailing addresses of its members (see Section 2. Members’ Information, below) for purposes of providing membership benefits and services to members. In addition, AHA collects email and mailing addresses in connection with registration for and attendance at conferences, webinars and other events, subscriptions for publications, the purchase of products and services, and in other circumstances. We may use your email address or other Personal Information to send commercial or marketing messages to you regarding AHA’s products or services. In addition, we may also use your name, mailing address, e-mail address, or other Personal Information (i) to send commercial or marketing messages on behalf of our affiliated organizations or on behalf of unrelated third parties, and/or (ii) in a mailing list sold to third parties for the marketing of their products and services. For example, we may share contact information you provide when you register for a conference or webinar with conference exhibitors or webinar sponsors so that they may send you commercial messages. You may opt-out of any or all of such disclosures as provided below.</p>

    <h3 id="surveys">e. Surveys</h3>

    <p>Our online surveys may ask respondents for contact, demographic and other Personal Information. The ways in which such information may be used or disclosed will be described in the survey materials. We also may use contact information from our surveys to send the user information about products and services of AHA, our affiliated organizations and/or unrelated third parties.</p>

    <h3 id="informationfromothersources">f. Information from Other Sources</h3>

    <p>The information we collect is gathered from several sources. Such sources may include, but are not limited to: membership enrollment; conference, webinar, distance learning and other event registration; website visits; newsletter and magazine subscriptions; and product sales. We may combine the information you submit when using one of our services with information (i) collected from your use of other AHA services, (ii) collected by AHA affiliated organizations, or (iii) obtained from third parties. The combined information may be used in a similar manner to any other information we collect.</p>

    <h2 id="membersinformation">2. Members’ Information</h2>

    <p>The AHA and its affiliated organizations offer individuals and institutions the opportunity to become members of the AHA and its affiliates. As part of membership enrollment, we may require or ask you for Personal Information and/or organizational information. We will create a member profile for you using such information and other information collected as described in this Privacy Policy. We may share the information in the member profile created with respect to membership in one AHA organization with other AHA affiliated organizations. The information you submit as part of your membership may also be used to compile a member directory or a list of persons registered to attend an event (either hardcopy or electronic). Such directories and lists may be shared with other members within a group, other registrants or third parties for marketing of their products and services.</p>

    <h3 id="publicprofiles">a. Public Profiles</h3>

    <p>Some or all of the information AHA collects from you as part of registrations of certain products and affiliates may be maintained in your account profile. This account profile will be visible to third parties accessing an AHA website except as set forth herein. We may make tools available for you in your account settings that will enable you to limit some of the data that will appear to third parties in your account profile.</p>

    <h2 id="thirdpartyadvertisers">3. Third Party Advertisers and Analytics</h2>

    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to AHA websites only. We may allow third party ad servers or ad networks to serve advertisements within AHA’s websites. These third party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the website. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may use other technologies such as cookies, scripting language or clear gifs to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see.</p>

    <p>These third parties may view, edit, or set their own cookies. They may also collect non-personal and personal information concerning your online activities over time and across different websites. The information they may collect includes the other sites you have visited or applications that you have downloaded to your mobile device, and other information about you or your device in order to help analyze and serve targeted advertising on the AHA website and elsewhere. For more information about third party ad servers and your ability to opt-out of targeted advertising from such third parties, please visit the <a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Network Advertising Initiative</a> and/or the Digital Advertising Alliance <a href="http://www.aboutads.info/choices/#completed" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising</a>.</p>

    <p>We may use a data analytics firm, such as Google Analytics, Ping Identity and Marketo to track and analyze traffic on an AHA website. These companies use cookies and similar technologies to collect and analyze information about use of the AHA website and report on activities and trends. This service may also collect information regarding the use of other websites, apps, and online resources. You can learn about Google’s privacy practices by reviewing their privacy terms, currently found at <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites</a>, and you can opt out of providing analytics by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available at <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout</a>. You can learn about Ping Identity privacy practices available at <a href="https://www.pingidentity.com/en/legal/privacy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://www.pingidentity.com/en/legal/privacy.html</a>.</p>

    <p>AHA does not provide any Personal Information to these third party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out.</p>

    <h2 id="donottrackandglobalprivacycontrolsignals">4. “Do Not Track” and Global Privacy Control Signals</h2>

    <p>Note that your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to websites and online services you visit. When you choose to turn on the “Do Not Track” settings in your browser, your browser will send a signal to websites, analytics providers, advertisements networks, plug-in providers, and other web service providers you encounter while browsing to stop tracking your activity. To find out more about “Do Not Track,” please visit <a href="https://allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">www.allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>

    <p>Global Privacy Control (“GPC”) is a technical specification in your browser settings that you can use to automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences with regard to third party online tracking. To find out more about and set up GPC, please visit <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="socialmediainteractions">5. Social Media Interactions and Third Party Links</h2>

    <p>AHA’s websites and publications contain many links to other websites. In addition, AHA and its affiliates may maintain a presence on third party sites such as Facebook® or LinkedIn®. These third party sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. AHA is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these other sites. Please review each site’s privacy policy to learn about how they may collect or use information.</p>

    <p>AHA websites may contain functionality that enables you to import profile information or contacts from third party services (e.g., LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, etc.) (collectively, “Third Party Accounts”). If you choose to do this, you may have to log into the applicable Third Party Account, using such account’s user name and password. The copy of the information received by us shall be subject to this Privacy Policy. However, any data maintained by in Third Party Accounts and by such third party service and your use of that third party service will be subject to that third party’s separate terms of use and privacy policy.</p>

    <h2 id="informationsharing">6. Information Sharing</h2>

    <p>In addition to the information sharing described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, the AHA shares Personal Information with AHA affiliated organizations and other trusted businesses or persons to perform functions on our behalf. These third parties have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.</p>

    <p>In the unlikely event that AHA or one of its affiliated organizations is acquired, or substantially all of the assets of AHA or one of its affiliated organizations are acquired, by a third party either in a sale, bankruptcy court proceeding or otherwise it is possible that Personal Information of website users and customers would be one of the assets transferred. In such an event, AHA would take reasonable steps to require the third party to maintain our privacy policies and practices.</p>

    <p>In addition, AHA may disclose Personal Information to third parties, but only:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>to contractors we use to support our business, provided they only use the Personal Information for AHA purposes;</li>
        <li>to respond to law enforcement requests, where required by applicable laws, court orders, warrants, subpoenas (whether civil or criminal) or governmental regulations;</li>
        <li>in situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person;</li>
        <li>in connection with joint ventures with third parties; or</li>
        <li>as necessary to enforce our rights in connection with an AHA website.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="informationsecurity">7. Information Security</h2>

    <p>AHA implements commercially reasonable security measures to help protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of data.

AHA does not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about any such children, and AHA does not knowingly market its products or services to any such children.

    <h2 id="consenttotransfer">9. Consent to Transfer</h2>

    <h2 id="changestoourprivacypolicy">10. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>AHA MAY MODIFY THIS PRIVACY POLICY AT ANY TIME, AND ANY CHANGE WILL BE EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING OF THE MODIFIED PRIVACY POLICY.

    <p>When making a request, individual users are asked to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed. Please note that there may be circumstances where we are not required to comply with your requests (e.g., if AHA has an ongoing requirement to retain your Personal Information for our own business or legal compliance purposes).

Correcting or removing data is done free of charge to the user unless doing so requires a disproportionate effort. After deleting your information from active servers, copies may remain in our backup system.</p>

    <p>Health Forum Inc. does not sell personal information to third parties.</p>

    <h3>Your Rights and Choices</h3>

    <p>The CCPA provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. This section describes your CCPA rights and explains how to exercise those rights.</p>

    <h4>Right to Know and Data Portability Rights</h4>

    <p>You have the right to request that Health Forum Inc. disclose certain information to you about our collection and use of your personal information over the past 12 months (the “right to know”). Once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see <a href="#exercisingyourrights">Exercising Your Rights to Know, Correct or Delete</a>), we will disclose to you:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The categories of personal information Health Forum Inc. collected about you.</li>
        <li>The categories of sources for the personal information Health Forum Inc. collected about you.</li>
        <li>Health Forum Inc.’s business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling that personal information.</li>
        <li>The categories of third parties with whom Health Forum Inc. shares that personal information.</li>
        <li>The specific pieces of personal information Health Forum Inc. collected about you (also called a data portability request).</li>
        <li>If Health Forum Inc. sold or disclosed your personal information for a business purpose, two separate lists disclosing:</li>
        <li>sales, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient purchased; and</li>
        <li>disclosures for a business purpose, identifying the personal information categories that each category of recipient obtained.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Right to Delete</h4>

    <p>You have the right to request that Health Forum Inc. delete any of your personal information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once Health Forum Inc. receives your request and confirm your identity (see <a href="#exercisingyourrights">Exercising Your Rights to Know, Correct or Delete</a>), we will review your request to see if an exception allowing us to retain the information applies. Health Forum Inc. may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service provider(s) to:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Complete the transaction for which Health Forum Inc. collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you;</li>
        <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities;</li>
        <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality;</li>
        <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law;</li>
        <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 et. seq.);</li>
        <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information’s deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research’s achievement, if you previously provided informed consent;</li>
        <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us;</li>
        <li>Comply with a legal obligation; or</li>
        <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Health Forum Inc. will delete or de-identify personal information not subject to one of these exceptions from our records and will direct our service providers to take similar action.</p>

    <h4>Right to Correct</h4>

    <p>You have the right to request that Health Forum Inc. correct inaccurate information we hold about you. Once we receive your request and confirm your identity (see <a href="#exercisingyourrights">Exercising Your Rights to Know, Correct or Delete</a>), we may deny your request if we find that the nature of and/or purpose for processing the personal information require us to preserve our existing records. Factors that may determine whether Health Forum Inc. modify information include (without limitation):</p>

    <ul>
        <li>How the personal information was collected;</li>
        <li>The source of the personal information;</li>
        <li>The sensitivity of the personal information;</li>
        <li>Documentation concerning the accuracy of the personal information; and/or</li>
        <li>Evidence that a correction request may be fraudulent or abusive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="exercisingyourrights">Exercising Your Rights to Know, Correct or Delete</h4>

    <p>To exercise your rights to know, correct or delete, please submit a request by submitting the information in the Health Forum Inc. California Consumer Privacy Act Request Form online, or providing the information in the following manner:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Calling us at <a href="tel:1-800-424-4301">1-800-424-4301</a></li>
        <li>Visiting us at <a href="/2023-05-18-health-forum-inc-california-consumer-privacy-act-request-form" target="_blank">Health Forum Inc California Consumer Privacy Act Request Form</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request to know, correct or delete related to your personal information. To designate an authorized agent, please provide the Health Forum Inc. California Consumer Privacy Act Request Form and the power of attorney form or other written document which permit the authorized agent to make requests on your behalf.</p>

    <p>You may only submit a request to know twice within a 12-month period. Your request to know, correct or delete must:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom Health Forum Inc. collected personal information or an authorized representative:
        <ul>
            <li>Provide all information included in the <a href="/2023-05-18-health-forum-inc-california-consumer-privacy-act-request-form" target="_blank">Health Forum Inc. California Consumer Privacy Act Request Form</a>. Health Forum Inc. will use this information to compare with the information stored in our technology systems.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Health Forum Inc. cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you.</p>

    <p>You do not need to create an account with us to submit a request to know, correct or delete. However, Health Forum Inc. does consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to personal information associated with that specific account.</p>

    <p>Health Forum Inc. will only use personal information provided in the request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.</p>

    <p>For instructions on exercising sale opt-out rights, see <a href="#personalinformationsales">Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</a>.</p>

    <h4>Response Timing and Format</h4>

    <p>Health Forum Inc. will confirm receipt of your request within ten (10) business days. If you do not receive confirmation within the 10-day timeframe, please contact us at <a href="mailto:compliance@aha.org?subject=Health Forum Inc. California Consumer Privacy Act Request Form Response Time">compliance@aha.org</a>.</p>

    <p>Health Forum Inc. endeavors to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 45 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing.</p>

    <p>If you have an account with us, Health Forum Inc. may deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.</p>

    <p>Any disclosures Health Forum Inc. provides will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, Health Forum Inc. will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>

    <p>Health Forum Inc. does not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>

    <h4 id="personalinformationsales">Personal Information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</h4>

    <p>If you are age 16 or older, you have the right to direct us to not sell your personal information at any time (the “right to opt-out”). Health Forum Inc. does not sell the personal information of consumers we actually know are less than 16 years old. Consumers who opt-in to personal information sales may opt-out of future sales at any time.</p>

    <p>To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative who provides written documentation authorizing to act on your behalf) may submit a request to us by visiting the following Internet Web page link:</p>

    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h4>Do Not Track/Global Privacy Control (“GPC”)</h4>

    <p>Do Not Track (“DNT”) and Global Privacy Controls (“GPC”) offered by some web browsers are settings that automatically inform websites of your privacy preferences with regard to third party online tracking, including exercising your rights and requesting the web application to disable tracking you. When you choose to turn on the DNT/GPC setting in your browser, your browser sends a special signal to websites, analytics companies, ad networks, plug in providers, and/or other web services you encounter while browsing to exercise your privacy rights and stop tracking your activity. You can learn more about and <a href="http://www.allaboutdnt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">set up Do Not Track</a> and <a href="https://globalprivacycontrol.org/#about" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">set up GPC</a>. There is no clear consensus on what it means to comply with these signals and Health Forum Inc. typically does not take additional steps in response to them, but we comply with DNT and GPC as specifically required under applicable law.</p>

    <h4>Limit the Use of Sensitive Personal Information</h4>

    <p>Health Forum Inc. does not process sensitive personal information that is subject to this limitation. Health Forum Inc. only uses and discloses sensitive personal information that it collected about the consumer for the purposes specified in the section 7027, subsection (m), of the California Consumer Privacy Act Regulations.</p>

    <h3>Non-Discrimination</h3>

    <p>Health Forum Inc. will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. Unless permitted by the CCPA, we will not:</p>
